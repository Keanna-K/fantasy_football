# Predictive Modelling for Fantasy Football

## INTRO

Each year, ESPN hosts the NFL Pigskin Pick'em fantasy football league. The objective is to select the winner of each NFL game throughout the 17-week season. There are three slightly different versions of game play, straight, spread, and confidence. This project focuses on developping a model based on the point spread format. In the spread format, each game is assigned a point spread/handicap which helps to even the playing field and make the matchups more competitive.
